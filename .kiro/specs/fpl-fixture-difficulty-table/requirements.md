# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a fixture difficulty table for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) that helps users assess the difficulty of upcoming fixtures for each team. The table will utilize existing API routes for league data and provide visual indicators to help FPL managers make informed decisions about player transfers and captaincy choices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want to view a fixture difficulty table showing upcoming matches for all teams, so that I can identify which teams have easier or harder runs of fixtures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the fixture difficulty table THEN the system SHALL display all 20 Premier League teams
2. WHEN the table loads THEN the system SHALL show the next 5-8 gameweeks of fixtures for each team
3. WHEN displaying fixtures THEN the system SHALL show opponent team names and match venues (home/away)
4. WHEN the table is displayed THEN the system SHALL be sortable by team name and difficulty metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want fixtures to be color-coded by difficulty level using official FPL difficulty data, so that I can quickly identify favorable and challenging periods for each team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying fixtures THEN the system SHALL apply color coding based on difficulty data from the FPL API
2. WHEN determining difficulty THEN the system SHALL use the official FPL difficulty rating (1=easiest, 5=hardest)
3. WHEN showing easy fixtures (1-2) THEN the system SHALL use green color coding
4. WHEN showing medium fixtures (3) THEN the system SHALL use yellow/amber color coding
5. WHEN showing hard fixtures (4-5) THEN the system SHALL use red color coding
6. WHEN fixtures are home matches THEN the system SHALL indicate this with appropriate styling
7. WHEN API provides difficulty ratings THEN the system SHALL use those values rather than calculating custom difficulty scores

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want to see aggregate difficulty scores for each team's upcoming fixtures, so that I can compare overall fixture difficulty across teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the table THEN the system SHALL calculate and display an average difficulty score for each team
2. WHEN calculating averages THEN the system SHALL consider the next 5 gameweeks as the primary metric
3. WHEN displaying aggregate scores THEN the system SHALL round to one decimal place
4. WHEN showing aggregate data THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by difficulty score (easiest to hardest)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want the fixture data to be current and accurate, so that I can rely on the information for my team decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch current fixture data from the existing API routes
2. WHEN API data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN fixture data is stale THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh mechanism
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want to use number input fields to select a gameweek range to analyze, so that I can quickly and precisely specify my planning horizon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the table THEN the system SHALL provide two number input fields for start and end gameweek selection
2. WHEN using the inputs THEN the system SHALL allow selection between gameweeks 1-38 with clear validation
3. WHEN typing in the inputs THEN the system SHALL validate values in real-time and show error messages for invalid entries
4. WHEN submitting valid values THEN the system SHALL update both the fixture display and aggregate difficulty scores
5. WHEN adjusting the range THEN the system SHALL maintain the current sort order and team selection
6. WHEN changing values THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without full page reloads
7. WHEN inputs contain invalid values THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and reset to valid values on blur
8. WHEN start gameweek is greater than end gameweek THEN the system SHALL show a validation error
9. WHEN values are outside the 1-38 range THEN the system SHALL show appropriate boundary error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want to search for specific teams or filter to a range of teams, so that I can focus on the teams most relevant to my squad.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the table THEN the system SHALL provide a search input field for team filtering
2. WHEN typing in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter teams in real-time based on team name matches
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support partial matches and be case-insensitive
4. WHEN multiple teams match THEN the system SHALL display all matching teams in the table
5. WHEN clearing the search THEN the system SHALL return to showing all 20 teams
6. WHEN no teams match the search THEN the system SHALL display a "no teams found" message
7. WHEN search is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all other functionality (sorting, gameweek selection)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an FPL manager, I want the table to be responsive and easy to read on different devices, so that I can check fixture difficulty on mobile and desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a condensed but readable table format
2. WHEN on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most important fixture information
3. WHEN the table is too wide THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling capabilities
4. WHEN displaying on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain color coding visibility and contrast
